# Clickey

### Listen to your keystrokes.

This application produces small wav sounds on every keystroke just like an iPhone keyboard.

### How to run

For Mac OS, I have already included Clickey.app in /Bundled Applications.

#### Note
Will require system permissions when you'll run it for the first time.

For Linux/Windows : (Assuming you have java installed)
```
git clone https://github.com/piyush0/Clickey

cd Clickey/"Bundled Applications"

java -jar Clickey.jar
```
